                            There was something about this day, the way the ocean stretched endlessly behind them, the
                            way the breeze carried the scent of flowers, the way time seemed to slow as they stood
                            together. Wrapped in emotions, they held each other close, promising a lifetime of love with
                            every glance, every touch. It wasn’t just a wedding; it was a feeling, of home, of
                            belonging, of knowing that no matter where life takes them, they’ll always find their way
